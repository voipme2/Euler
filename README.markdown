## Euler

I had some free time, and I wanted to keep my Python skills up to date, so I started working through the Project
Euler problems.  Its not the most efficient, but it gets the job done.

While a lot of the Project Euler problems have been answered using Python, I figured I've give it a wack.

Written with Python 3.2.

### A Note
I didn't put this on Github so people could solve the problems without even trying.  I'm sure that if you just wanted
to answer as many questions on Project Euler, you could just Google the answers.
